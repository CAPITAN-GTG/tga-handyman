              We've seen cracks from settling homes, doorknob holes, holes made on accident by kids or adults, 
              as well as drywall anchor holes and moisture damage. Different types of drywall damage require 
              different types of repair. After years of experience, we can confidently tackle any drywall repair 
              project except for repairs on a flooded property.

              <p className="text-gray-600 mb-6">
                Drywall repairs involve cutting out the old drywall, adding struts between the studs to make it 
                possible to attach the new drywall with screws, and taking care of the joints. The joints can be 
                covered with drywall tape or with mudding. When mudding is used, we then have to use a sander so 
                that any imperfections in the mudding is smoothened before the wall is painted over.

                We are capable of matching the color and texture of your existing wall, but as with these types 
                of repairs, there is a chance it won't always come out exactly the same. Our team members will 
                always work with you to explain the specifics of your situation so that you know what to expect.

                <p className="text-gray-600">
                  In the unfortunate event that your home has recently been flooded we will have to put you in 
                  touch with flood damage specialists that can properly dry the home and validate that it is ready 
                  for repairs before we begin. Replacing drywall in a moist home will lead to it becoming moist 
                  and moldy soon-after, which is why it should never be done.
                </p>
                <p className="text-gray-600">
                  We can also paint an entire wall on which drywall is replaced, if you want to make sure that 
                  it all looks even. Last but not least, we clean up after ourselves by vacuuming and disposing 
                  of any debris that may accumulate in the process of repairing drywall.
